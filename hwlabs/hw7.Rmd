## Simulation

1. Perform the following exercises.
    
    a. Simulate a sample of $100$ observations $X_i$, $i=1,\dots,100$ from each of the following distributions. 
    Create a histogram each time. 
        i. A uniform distribution on $[-10, 10]$
        i. A beta distribution with $\alpha=\beta=1$
        i. A gamma distribution with mean 0.5 and variance 1 (you may need some on-paper calculation)
        i. Binomial distributions with $p=0.5$ and number of trials $n=4$. 
        i. Binomial distributions with $p=0.5$. The number of trials $n_i$ for $X_i$ itself follows a geometric distribution with success probability 0.2.

    a. Set the random seed to 2. Sample 30 random numbers from a chi-square distributions with degree of freedom 2. 
        i. Plot the histogram of the random numbers and overlay the density of the $\chi^2_2$ distribution
        i. Plot the empirical cdf and overlay the true cdf.
        i. Show a scatter plot for the empirical deciles vs the true deciles (namely, the $0.1, \dots, 0.9$-quantiles).
