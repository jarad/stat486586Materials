## Outline

class: big, middle

## dplyr

---

## `dplyr`

- `dplyr` is a database-like package for operating and performing calculation on data frames. 

- can produce numerical summaries

- can join data frames and combine information from different sources

- has convenient and neat syntax

---

## `dplyr` 

There are a couple of primary `dplyr` *verbs*, representing distinct data analysis tasks:

- `select`: Select particular *columns* of a data frame

- `filter`: Select specified *rows* of a data frame, produce a subset

- `mutate`: Add new or change existing columns of the data frame

---

## Common structure

Functions in `dplyr` have a data frame as their first input. The outputs are also data frames. E.g.,

- `select(fbi, Year, State)`

- `filter(fbi, Year >= 2017 & State == "Iowa")`


---

## R demo...

---

class: inverse

## Your turn: select, filter, and mutate

Use the `fbi` data from the `classdata` package  

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Create a data frame containing the state abbreviation, year, population, crime type, and crime count. 

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Continue the last part: Now create a data frame containing data in 2017 for all states except for Iowa.

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Continue the last part: Now introduce a column which is the number of crimes per thousand residents into the previous data frame.

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Continue the last part: Drop the population and crime count columns. 

---

## The pipe operator `%>%`

`lhs %>% f` means using `lhs` as the first argument in the next function. Read `%>%` as "then do":

- `x %>% g` is equivalent to `g(x)`,

- `x %>% g(y)` is equivalent to `g(x, y)`

Consequences:

- `f(x) %>% g(y)` is the same as `g(f(x), y)`

- complex statement `k(h(g(f(x, y), z), u), v, w)` can be written as 
`x %>% f(y) %>% g(z) %>% h(u) %>% k(v, w)`

---

## R demo...

---

class: inverse

## Your turn

Repeat the last your turn, but now using the pipe `%>%`: 

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> 1. Create a data frame containing the state abbreviation, year, population, crime type, and crime count. 2. Include data in 2017 for all states except for Iowa. 3. Introduce a column which is the number of crimes per thousand residence into the previous data frame. 4. Lastly, drop the population and crime count columns. 

---

## More `dplyr` **verbs**

- `distinct`: Select only unique rows from a data frame

- `arrange`: Reorder the rows of a data frame

- `summarize`: Create collapsed summaries of a data frame

- `group_by`: Do something for each group level

---

## R demo...

---

class: inverse

## Your turn: distinct, summarize, group_by, and arrange

Use the `fbi` data from the `classdata` package  

<img src="images/blue.png" width=20> What is the population of each state in 2017? Remove redundant information using `distinct`. 

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Find the crime rate for each year and each type of crime. 

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Arrange your finding by the crime rate from high to low.

<img src="images/blue.png" width=20> Look at just burglary. How does the crime rate compare with the all-time high within each state?

## Usage Summaries

---

## `select`

Take out specific columns/variables of a data frame:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(classdata)
library(dplyr)
dat <- select(fbi, Type, Count, State, Year)
head(dat)
# All same as dat except for column order
dat1 <- select(fbi, -Abb, -Violent.crime, -Population)
dat2 <- select(fbi, c(1, 3, 5:6))
dat3 <- select(fbi, c(-2, -4, -7))
```

---

## `filter`

Take out a subset of the rows/observations:

```{r, message=FALSE}
dat <- filter(fbi, Type=="Burglary" & Year==2014)
head(dat)
```

---

## `mutate`

Introduce a new variable into a data set or transform/update an old variable:

```{r}
head(mutate(fbi, Rate = Count/Population*1000))
```

---

## Using the pipe `%>%`

```
dat <- select(fbi, -Abb)
dat1 <- filter(dat, State == "Iowa" & Year == 2017)
```

becomes

```
fbi %>% 
  select(-Abb) %>%
  filter(State == "Iowa" & Year == 2017)
```

---

## `distinct`
`distinct` selects only unique/distinct rows from a data frame. You can determine uniqueness using all combination of columns or a subset of them


```{r, message=FALSE}
fbi %>% 
  distinct(Year, State, Population) %>% head()
```

---

## `arrange`

`arrange` sorts a data set by the values in one or more variables: Sort by the first variable; if multiple entries have the same value in the first variable, sort by their second variable, and so on.

`desc` stands for descending, otherwise rows are sorted from smallest to largest

```{r, message=FALSE}
fbi %>% arrange(Year, Type, desc(Count)) %>% head()
```

---

## `summarize`

summarize (or aggregates) observations into a (set of) one-number statistic(s):



```{r}
summarize(fbi, 
          mean = mean(Count, na.rm=TRUE),
          sd = sd(Count, na.rm=TRUE),
          nrows = n())
```

---

## `group_by`: Do something for each level

```{r}
fbi2017 <- fbi %>% 
  select(State, Year, Type, Count) %>% 
  filter(Year == 2017 & 
           Type != "Legacy.rape")
fbi2017 %>%
  group_by(Type) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(Count, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd = sd(Count, na.rm=TRUE)) 
```
