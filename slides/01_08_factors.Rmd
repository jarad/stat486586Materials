## Factor variables

---

## Overview

- What is a factor variable

- Why is it important

- Inspecting, creating, and using factor variables

- Type casting

---

## Factors in R

- A type of variable to indicate *categories*

- Stores both *levels* and the *order* of the levels

- It is more than a character vector, which does not store the order information

---

## The `fbi` data

```{r}
library(classdata)
str(fbi)
```

---

## Using factors in R

- Many R functions behave nicely when applied on a factor, for example `boxplot(x ~ fct)` creates a side-by-side boxplot of `x` in different groups specified by the levels in `fct`

- The order of factor levels affects the order of the boxes. It is crucial to arrange them in a meaningful order for presentation!

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
boxplot(fbi$Count ~ fbi$Type)
```

---

## Working with factors

- `table`, `str` inspect a factor

- `factor` creates a new factor with specified levels

- `levels`, `levels<-` extracts and set the levels

- `reorder(fct, numbers, FUN)` reorders a factor `fct` according to a summary statistic `FUN` of `numbers`

## R demo...

---

## Additional notes

- Sometimes text variables are stored in factors during input by default

- Numeric variables and factors are treated differently in R, and they have to be converted manually

## Your turn

For this your turn use the `fbi` object from the `classdata` package. 

- <img src="images/green.png" width=20> Introduce a rate of the number of reported offenses by population into the `fbi` data. 

- <img src="images/blue.png" width=20> 
Plot boxplots of crime rates by different types of crime. How can you make axis text legible? 

- <img src="images/blue.png" width=20> 
Reorder the boxplots of crime rates, such that the crime types are ordered by the median crime rates.

## Quick summary of demo

---

## Reordering factor levels manually

```{r}
levels(fbi$Type)
```

Reorder so that property crimes come first (extremely sensitive to typos):

```{r}
levels(factor(fbi$Type, levels=c("Larceny.theft", "Burglary", "Motor.vehicle.theft", "Aggravated.assault", "Robbery", "Legacy.rape", "Murder.and.nonnegligent.Manslaughter", "Rape")))
```

---

## Reordering factor levels - using another variable

`reorder(factor, numbers, function)`

reorder levels in factor by values in `numbers`. Use `function` to summarize (average is used by default). 

```{r}
levels(reorder(fbi$Type, fbi$Count, mean, na.rm=TRUE))
```
Missing values in `numbers`? make sure to use parameter `na.rm=TRUE`!

---

## Changing levels' names

```{r}
levels(fbi$Type)
```

```{r}
levels(fbi$Type)[6] <- "Murder"

levels(fbi$Type)
```
