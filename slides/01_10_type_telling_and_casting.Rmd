## Type Telling and Casting

---

## Outline

- Type-telling funcitons

- Type-casting funcitons

---

## Why do we care about object types?

- Numeric operations do not apply to character vectors

```{r,error = TRUE}
x <- '123'
x + 1
```

- When comparing a numeric vector and a character vector, the former will be converted to a character vector. This is call an *implicit conversion*. The vectors will then be compared using the dictionary order.

```{r}
0.01 <= '0.05'
```

- .danger[But implicit conversion is problematic, so definitely avoid]

```{r}
0.0001 <= '0.05'
```

## Type-telling funcitons

Functions that look like `is.typexxx(y)` will tell you whether `y` is of type `typexxx`. E.g.,

- `is.numeric`
- `is.character`
- `is.factor`
- `is.matrix`
- `is.list`
- `is.data.frame`
- etc, etc

Useful later for writing code in a function depending on the type of user input

---

## Type-casting functions

Functions that look like `as.typexxx(y)` will convert `y` to an object of type `typexxx`. E.g.,

- `as.numeric`
- `as.character`
- `as.factor`
- `as.matrix`
- `as.list`
- `as.data.frame`
- etc, etc

Useful later for converting user inputs to the types you would like

---

## Casting a factor variable

![](images/casting.png)
**Note:** `as.numeric` applied to a factor retrieves *order* of labels, not labels, even if those could be interpreted as numbers.

To get the labels of a factor as numbers, first cast to character and then to a number.

## Your turn

Start with the vector `x <- c(1998, 1999, 1998)`

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Cast `x` to a character vector. Use a type telling function to confirm your result has the right type

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Cast the previous result into a factor. Use a type telling function to confirm your result has the right type

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Cast the previous result into a numeric vector. Use a type telling function to confirm your result has the right type. Check the values are the same as the ones you started with
