## Strings in R

---

## Outline

- What are strings?

- Showing strings

- Basic string functions

- Matching patterns with regular expressions

- More string functions

---

## What are strings?

- Many interesting data are stored in the form of text strings. E.g., group membership, speech, websites, etc.

- Ultimately, analysts like to deal with numeric using models, so text data need to be converted to numbers

- Thus, we need skills to deal with strings

- Character vectors in R store strings. A string is made up of zero or more individual characters

- The following are all strings

  ```
  ""
  "z"
  "hello world"
  c("hello", "world")
  "Mary's friend says: \n \t \"Hello!\""
  ```

---

## Strings
```
x <- "Mary's friend says: \n \t \"Hello!\""
single <- "'"
double <- '"'
```

- Some characters must be *escaped* using the backslash `\` to be a part of a string
  - `\n`: newline. It is a single character
  - `\t`: a tab
  - `\"`: a double quote
  - `\\`: a single backslash
  
- Using single and double quotes for strings are both fine. .style[Double quotes are recommended, unless your string has a double quote.]

---

## Showing strings

- `print(x)` shows all character contents literally including the escape symbols

- `writeLine(x)` format the string in a reader-friendly manner by interpreting the escaped symbols


---

## String functions

R has many string functions built-in, but we will be using the `stringr` library which provides a unified interface to string functions. To load the package, issue

```{r}
library(stringr) #Does not work? Run install.packages('stringr') first
```

- `str_length` tells the number of characters in a (vector of) string
- `str_c` combines two or more strings elementwise. It can also connect all strings together into one
- `str_sub` extracts a part of a string
- `str_to_lower`, `str_to_upper`, `str_to_title` convert cases in a string

---

## Matching patterns 

- We often need to describe what we need using patterns

- E.g.
    - which days are in May among `c("May 5", "June 4", "May 8")`
    - extract the day parts in `c("May 5", "June 4")`
    - which students have a first name Jacob among </br> `c("Smith, Jacob", "Jacobi, Neal", "Pearl, Jacob")`
    
- `str_view` visualizes the matching process for learning patterns

```
x <- c("May 5", "June 4", "July 8")
str_view(x, "May")
```

---

## Regular expression

Regular expression (Regexp) is a concise and flexible way to describe patterns in strings.

- `.` means any character that is not a newline

- `^` matches the start of the string, and `$` the end of the string

```
str_view(c("Smith, Jacob", "Jacobi, Neal", "Pearl, Jacob")`, 
         "Jacob$")
```

- There are character classes that matches any character within a collection. E.g.,
    - `[:alnum:]`: any alphabetic or numeric characters
    - `\d`: any digit
    - `\d?`, 0 or 1 digit; `\d+`, 1 or more digits; `\d*`:  0 or more digits
    - `\s`: any whitespace
    - [abc]: a or b or c
    - [^abc]: anything but a, b, or c

---

## More string functions

- `str_detect(string, pattern)` detects whether `pattern` occurs in `string`

- `str_extract(string, pattern)` extracts the first matched pattern from `string`. `str_extract_all` extracts all matches

<!-- - Similarly, `str_locate` and `str_locate_all` returns the starting and ending location(s) of each match -->

- `str_replace(string, pattern, replacement)` replaces the first matched pattern. `str_replace_all` replaces all matches

- `str_split(string, pattern)` splits the string at the matched patterns
