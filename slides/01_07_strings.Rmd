## Strings in R

---

## Outline

- What are strings?

- Creating strings

- Showing strings

- Basic string functions

- Matching patterns with regular expressions

- More string functions

---

## What are strings?

- Many interesting data are stored in the form of text strings. E.g., group membership, speech, websites, etc.

- Ultimately, analysts like to deal with numeric using models, so text data need to be converted to numbers

- Automatic generation of reports involves string manipulation

- Character vectors in R store strings. A string is made up of zero or more individual characters

---

## Creating strings

- Strings can be created by surrounding texts with a pair of single or double quotes (both are fine)

  ```
  ""
  "z"
  'hello world'
  c("hello", "world")
  ```

- Some more strange examples:
    ```{r}
    single <- "'"
    double <- '"'
    x <- "Mary's friend says: \n \t \"Hello!\""
    ```

- Some characters must be *escaped* using the backslash `\` to be a part of a string
  - `\n`: newline. It is a single character
  - `\t`: a tab
  - `\"`: a double quote
  - `\\`: a single backslash
  
---

- .style[Double quotes are recommended for creating strings, unless your string has a double quote]

---

## Showing strings

- `print(x)` shows all character contents literally (unformatted) including the escape symbols

- `writeLines(x)` format the string in a reader-friendly (formatted) manner by interpreting the escaped symbols

```{r}
writeLines(x)
```

## Demo

class: inverse

## Your Turn

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Create a string containing `O'Neal`

<img src="images/blue.png" width=20> Create a string containing a newline, a right slash, and a double quote. Remember to escape. Assign the string to a variable `s`

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Display `s` both unformatted and formatted 

---

## Basic string functions

R has many string functions built-in, but we will be using the `stringr` library which provides a unified interface to string functions. To load the package, issue

```{r}
library(stringr) #Does not work? Run install.packages('stringr') first
```

- `str_length` tells the number of characters in a (vector of) string

- `str_c` combines two or more strings elementwise. It can also connect all strings together into one

- `str_sub` extracts a part of a string

- `str_to_lower`, `str_to_upper`, `str_to_title` convert cases in a string

---

## Demo

## Matching patterns 

- We often need to describe what we need using patterns

- E.g.
    - which students have a first name Jacob among </br> `c("Shaw, Jacob", "Jacobi, Neal", "Pearl, Jacob")`
    - extract the first and the last names
    
- `str_view_all` visualizes the matching process for learning patterns. It highlight all matches (`str_view` highlights only the first match)

```
x <- c("Shaw, Jacob", "Jacobi, Neal", "Pearl, Jacob")
str_view_all(x, "Jacob")
```

---

## Regular expression

Regular expression (Regexp) is a concise and flexible way to describe patterns in strings.


- `^` matches the start of the string, and `$` the end of the string

```
str_view_all(x, "Jacob$")
```

- `.` means any character that is not a newline

- Quantifiers specify how many instances of a specific pattern must be found for a match. E.g., `.?` matches 0 or 1 character; `.+`, 1 or more characters; `.*`:  0 or more characters

- There are character classes that matches any character within a collection. E.g.,
    - `[:alnum:]`: any alphabetic or numeric characters
    - `\d`: any digit
    - `\s`: any whitespace
    - [abc]: a or b or c
    - [^abc]: anything but a, b, or c

---

## More string functions

- `str_detect(string, pattern)` detects whether `pattern` occurs in `string`

- `str_count(string, pattern)` counts the number of times `pattern` occurs in `string`

- `str_extract(string, pattern)` extracts the first matched pattern from `string`. `str_extract_all` extracts all matches

<!-- - Similarly, `str_locate` and `str_locate_all` returns the starting and ending location(s) of each match -->

- `str_replace(string, pattern, replacement)` replaces the first matched pattern. `str_replace_all` replaces all matches

- `str_split(string, pattern)` splits the string at the matched patterns

---

## Demo

class: inverse

## Your Turn

Start with a shopping list `fruit <- c("apple", "banana", "pear", "pinapple")`

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Find the number of characters in each string in `fruit`

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Create a character vector in which each entry contains a fruit name and a quantity (say, 4, 2, 1, and 2 for the four types of fruit)

<img src="images/blue.png" width=20> Use `str_detect` to find which fruits have a name containing `apple`
