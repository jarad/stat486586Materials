## The 2020 Cyclone football data

- Iowa State University Athelete hosts some statistics for the Cyclone football team for the current season [here](https://cyclones.com/cumestats.aspx?path=football). 

- When using dataset on the internet, always check whether you have the permission to do so!

- An excerpt of the individual player data is available from our course website. Dowload the [excel file](cyclonesFootball2020.xlsx) and put the file next to your Rmd file. Look at what does the file contain. 

---

## Loading data
The following command is going to load the per-game defense data into your R session:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(readxl)
defense <- read_excel('cyclonesFootball2020.xlsx', sheet='Defensive')
str(defense)
```

## R demo...

class: inverse

## Your turn: group_by and summarize 

For this your turn use the `defense` data from the `cyclonesFootball2020.xlsx` 

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> What is the total number of tackle assists per game?

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Which two ISU players have the highest average number of tackle assists? 

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Is our defense more successful against U of Iowa or TCU? Filter data first and compare total number of solo tackles. 

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> What is the relationship between the ability of solo tackles and tackles assists? 

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Find a plot that shows the differences for each one of the above summaries.

## Brief Summaries

## Cleaning up `defense`

- convert numbers to numeric variable: `as.numeric`: 
- here I clean up solo tackles & tackle assists
- the remaining cleaning is just pretty tedious manual work ...

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
defense <- defense %>% 
    mutate(Tackles_Solo = as.numeric(Tackles_Solo),
           Tackles_ASST = as.numeric(Tackles_ASST)) 
str(defense)
```

---

## More cleaning

- Change the name for the opponent column
- order the Opponent column in a meaningful fashion: factor, and make 'UNI' the first level

```{r}
defense <- defense %>% 
    rename(Opponent=Opponent_Opponent) %>% 
    mutate(Opponent = factor(Opponent))

lvls <- as.character(sort(unique(defense$Opponent)))
lvls <- c('UNI', lvls[lvls != 'UNI'])
defense <- defense %>% 
  mutate(Opponent = factor(Opponent, lvls))
```

---

## The variable `Tackles_Solo`

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4.5}
defense %>% ggplot(aes(x = Tackles_Solo)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

---


## Summarizing dataset
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
defense %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), solo = sum(Tackles_Solo))
defense %>% 
  group_by(Opponent) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), solo = sum(Tackles_Solo)) %>% 
  arrange(solo) %>% 
  head(3)
```

---

## Summarizing Tackles

The total number of solo tackles in each game

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, message=FALSE}
soloPerGame <- defense %>% 
  group_by(Opponent) %>% 
  summarize(solo = sum(Tackles_Solo))
ggplot(soloPerGame, aes(x=Opponent, weight=solo)) + geom_bar() + coord_flip()
```

---


## Helper function

- Counting players appeared in each game: `n()` provides the number of rows of a subset:
```{r, message=FALSE}
defense %>% 
  group_by(Opponent) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), solo = sum(Tackles_Solo)) %>% 
  str
```
