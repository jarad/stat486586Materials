## How does R find variables in functions?

Use your intuition to predict what the following functions output:

1. 
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    x <- 1
    f1 <- function() {
      x <- 2
      print(x)
    }
    f1()
    ```

2. 
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    f2 <- function() {
      if (!exists("a")) {
        a <- 1
      } else {
        a <- a + 1
      }
      a
    }
    f2()
    f2()
    ```

---

3\. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
power <- 2
map_dbl(1:3, function(x) x ^ power)
```
    
4\. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
times <- 1
f3 <- function(x) rep(x, times)
g <- function(x) {
  times <- 2
  f3(x)
}
g(1)
```

At the end of the class, you will understand why the functions behave as such, and also understand more rules for how R find things (and thus you can program better).

class: big, middle

## How does R know *where* to find variables?

---

## Lexical scoping

- R follows *lexical scoping*, namely where it looks up values of variable names based on how a function is defined, not how it is called

- This means that, where the code find the names it needs is decided by the author of the code. The user can modify the behavior of the code only through changing the input, not through changing non-input variables in the environment

- (This is as opposed to *dynamic scoping*, which look up values based on how a function is called)


---

## Four rules for lexical scoping

1. *Masking*: Variables defined inside a function mask variables defined outside a function
    ```{r, eval=TRUE}
    x <- 1
    f1 <- function() {
      x <- 2
      print(x)
    }
    f1()
    ```

---

1. *Masking cont*: If a variable isn’t defined inside a function, R looks one level up *where the function is defined*
    ```{r, eval=TRUE}
    x <- 1
    f1_1 <- function() {
      print(x)
    }
    f1_1()
    ```
    
    ... *not where the function is called*
    ```{r, eval=TRUE}
    times <- 1
    f3 <- function(x) rep(x, times)
    g <- function(x) {
      times <- 2
      f3(x)
    }
    g(1)
    ```
---

1. *Masking cont*: The masking rule applies the same if a function is defined inside another function

```{r}
x <- 0
f1_2 <- function() {
  x <- 1
  g <- function() {
    y <- 2
    c(x, y)
  }
  g()
}
f1_2()
```
---

2\. *Functions are ordinary variables*, so the scoping rules apply when looking up both functions and variables

```{r}
g <- sum
f2_1 <- function() {
  g <- mean
  g(1:2)
}
f2_1()
```

---

3\. *Fresh starts*: The excution of a function is not affected by the previous excutions
```{r}
f2 <- function() {
  if (!exists("a")) {
    a <- 1
  } else {
    a <- a + 1
  }
  a
}
f2()
f2()
```

---

4\. *Dynamic lookup*. (Lexical scoping determines where, but not when to look for values.) R looks up the values when the function is run, not when the function is created

```{r}
x <- 1
f_4 <- function() x
x <- 2
f_4()
```

## Mechanism for the scoping rules: Environments

---

## Binding values

- All R objects are pieces floating in your computer memory

- When you create `x <- c(1, 2, 3)`, 
    - there is a piece of memory storing the values `c(1, 2, 3)`
    - R knows that the variable name (symbol) `x` is bound to that value

</br>Figures are due to [Hadley Wickham](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)
]

- Similarly, a data frame `d1 <- data.frame(x = c(1, 5, 6), y = c(2, 4, 3))` behaves like

]

---

## Environment

An environment is a container of variables (which can itself be a variable like `e1`)

.center[
![:scale 40%](images/environment1.png)
]

---

## The global environment

- The *global environment* is where the R console evaluate your expressions

- It is sometimes called the "workspace"

- Type `ls()` in the R console to see the variables in the global environment

- You can also use the RStudio Environment browser tab

---

## Parent environment

- Each environment has a *parent*, which is another environment

- The parent of the global environment is a package environment containing the functions offered by the package

- When looking up a variable (function), R is going to look up the chain of environments until it finds the first match.

- The following figure explains how does R find the `sd` function when you type it in the console, which does not exist in the global environment.

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/envPackages.png)
]

- A digression: The order of the attached packages (environments) is known as the *search path*. See `search()`

---

## The function environment

The environment of a function, called the *function environment*, is the environment where the function is created. E.g., for 

```
y <- 1
f <- function(x) x + y
```

.center[
![:scale 50%](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/cd8208b418ecbaf6ace1b6453b93fdf628173e01/68d59/diagrams/environments/binding.png)
]

---

- So, in reality, a function has three parts, the arguments, the code inside the function, and the *function environment* which determines where to find the variables it uses

- You may see functions are called closures. This name reflects the fact that a function enclose its environment
    ```{r}
    typeof(mean)
    ```

---

## The excecution environment

- Every time a function is called, its code are evaluated in a freshly created environment, called the *execution environment*
- The parent of the execution environment is the function environment
- The execution environment usually goes away after the function returns

```{r}
h <- function(x) { # 1.
  a <- 2 # 2.
  x + a
}
y <- h(1) # 3.
```
.center[
![:scale 110%](images/executionHorizontal.png)
]

---

## A more complex example

A function that returns a function (function factory)
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
plus <- function(x) {
  function(y) x + y
}

plus_one <- plus(1)
```

.center[
![:scale 25%](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/853b74c3293fae253c978b73c55f3d0531d746c5/6ffd5/diagrams/environments/closure.png)
]

- The function environment of `plus_one` is the execution environment of `plus(1)`
---

## A more complex example cont.

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
plus_one
plus_one(2)
```

.center[
![:scale 30%](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/66676485e6a22c807c19b0c54c8fda6bd1292531/3526e/diagrams/environments/closure-call.png)
]

- When `plus_one` is executed, the execution environment has a parent function environment that contains `x`

## Lazy evaluation

---
## Lazy evaluation
R function arguments are lazily evaluated. There are three principles:

1. Function arguments are held as an unevaluated *expression* (or a *promise*). They are evaluated only if accessed

    E.g., `stop(message)` will produce an error
    ```{r, error=TRUE}
    stop("an error here")
    ```

    But you will not have an error running the following because the argument `x` is not used in `h()`
    ```{r, error=TRUE}
    h <- function(x) {
      10
    }
    h(stop("an error here"))
    ```

---

2\. The evaluation is done only once when the value is accessed, and then it is cached (remembered). So `double(20)` in the following example is evaluated only once

```{r}
double <- function(x) { 
  message("Calculating...")
  x * 2
}

h2 <- function(x) {
  c(x, x)
}

h2(double(20))
```

---

3\. The evaluation is evaluated in the environment where the expression is defined

```{r}
tripple <- function(x)  x * 3
h3 <- function(x) {
  y <- 100
  x
}

y <- 1
h3(tripple(y))
```

---

## Some implications of lazy evaluation

We are going to see some implications of lazy evaluation

1. Specifying default arguments for a function

1. Non-standard evaluation

---

## Default arguments

- The default argument of a function can depend on another argument. E.g., see `?seq`

    A simplified e.g.
    ```{r}
    h4 <- function(x = 2 * y, y) {
      c(x, y)
    }
    h4(y=1)
    ```
    
    We do not have an error because `x = 2 * y` is no evaluated at the beginning of the function, but only evaluated at `c(x, y)`

---

- An empty argument can have a default as well

```{r}
h5 <- function(x) {
  if (missing(x)) {
    x <- "my default"
  }
  x
}
h5()
```

---

## Non-standard evaluation

*Non-standard evaluation* (NSE) is as opposed to standard evaluation rules which interpret arguments by the values

E.g. of NSE:

- `library` is NSE in its first argument
    ```{r, error=TRUE}
    library(MASS) # OK
    x <- "MASS"
    library(x) 
    ```

---

- `plot` is NSE in the `x` and `y` arguments
    ```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
    myX <- 1:10
    plot(myX, sin(myX)) # How does plot() set the label names?
    ```

- You will see more NSE examples (some super useful) when we introduce `dplyr`

## Function factories

---

## Function factories

A *function factory* is a function which returns functions. In addition to `plus()` we say before, there is a second example

```{r}
power1 <- function(exp) {
  function(x) {
    x ^ exp
  }
}
square <- power1(2)
class(square)
square(2)
```

- `square()` is a *manufactured function*. It encloses a piece of data (`exp = 2`)

---
- *Closures* (functions with enclosed data) are very useful as input to R functions that takes a function as input, e.g., 
    - `integrate(f, lower, upper)`, for integrating a one-dimensional function `f`
    - `uniroot(f, interval)` and `optimise(f, interval)`, for searching for the root (i.e., zero point) or the minimum/maximum of a one-dimensional `f`
    - `optim(par, fn)`, for searching for the minimum or maximum of a multi-dimensional `fn`
    
E.g.,
```{r}
integrate(power1(3), 0, 1) # ∫ x^3 dx from 0 to 1
```

- In particular, the problem of finding maximum likelihood estimate can utilize a function factory, which takes a dataset as argument and output the likelihood function (homework)

---

## Forced evaluation

There is a subtle bug in `power1` due to lazy evaluation
```
power1 <- function(exp) {
  function(x) {
    x ^ exp
  }
}
```
```{r}
a <- 1
linear <- power1(a)
a <- 2
linear(3)
```

- You may hope the output to be 3, because the `linear` function is made with an exponent 1 by value, at the time of its definition

- This is not the case because of lazy evaluation. The value of `a` get bound to `linear` only at the first time `linear` is evaluated. At this moment, `a` equals 2

---

- To fix the issue, use `force()` to *force evaluate* `exp` before the function factory returns. The correct function is

```{r}
power2 <- function(exp) {
  force(exp)
  function(x) {
    x ^ exp
  }
}

a <- 1
linear <- power2(a)
a <- 2
linear(3)
```

## Your turn (TODO)

<img src="images/blue.png" width=20> Implement a function `mymean` with a single vector input `x` that outputs the mean of `x`, without using the `mean` function

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Call your function on `c(1, 3, 4)` and `c(1, 3, 4, 5)`. Make sure your function has the same output as `mean()`

<img src="images/blue.png" width=20> Now, add a second optional argument to `mymean`, which is a flag `na.rm` that defaults to `FALSE` to indicate whether to remove missing values before the mean calculation. You may use `is.na()`. Again, compare the results from your function and `mean()` to make sure your implementation is correct
