## Functional Programming

---

## Outline

- What is functional programming

- Applying functions repeatedly

- Combining results

- Applying functions by group

---

## Functional programming

- *functional programming* is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions

- This is as opposed to the *procedural programming* paradigm, where one specifies the series of computational steps to be carried out

- R is, by and large, a functional programming language

- In R, function is a first class object, namely a function behaves just like an ordinary variable

```{r}
f <- mean
f(1:5)
```

- Most R functions are *pure functions*, of which the outputs depends on only the inputs without side-effects (e.g., no modification of the inputs in-place)

---

## Why functional programming

- Functional programming is clear and concise. E.g., to read in several files in `files <- c("1.csv", "2.csv", "3.csv")`:

.pull-left[
Functional style
```
purrr::map(files, read.csv)
```
]

.pull-right[
Procedural style
```
results <- vector("list", 
                  length(files))
for (i in seq_along(files)) {
  results[[i]] <- read.csv(files[i])
}
```
]

- A functional programming style is great to use for programming statistical/mathematical methods

- .danger[You may think you can do everything using loops, but this will prevent you to build big things. Using functional programming, you will gain much more mileage as we learn more ]

## Applying functions

---

## `purrr`

- We will be using the functional programming library `purrr`

- `purrr` is a complete and consistent set of tools to enhance Râ€™s basic functional programming toolkit

- Load the library using 

```{r}
library(purrr)
```

---

## Applying a function to different inputs

`map(.x, .f,)` applies the function `.f` to each entry in `.x`, which may be a list or a vector

</br>Figures are due to [Hadley Wickham](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html)
]

- `map` always returns a list, so it is very general

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
x <- list(c(1, 2, 3, 10), 2:3)
map(x, mean)
```

---

- You can define an arbitrary function and use it with map.

```{r}
standardize <- function(v) {
	(v - mean(v)) / sd(v)
}
map(x, standardize)
```

- You can use an *anonymous function* to perform short tasks that do not warrant names

```{r, eval=FALSE}
map(x, function(v) (v - mean(v)) / sd(v))
```
or
```{r, eval=FALSE}
map(x, function(v) { # calculate the 2nd moment
  v2 <- v^2
  mean(v2)
})
```

---

```
map(.x, .f, ...)
```

You can specify common optional arguments to your function using `...`

]
```{r}
y <- list(c(NA, 1:5), 2:3)
map(y, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
```

---

## Returning atomic vectors

- You can convert a list of scalars to a vector using `unlist`

- Better yet, use `purrr` functions that returns a *scalar* of specific types:

    ```
    map_dbl()
    map_int()
    map_lgl()
    map_chr()
    ```

- These functions are more specific, and thus more rigorous and easier to reason with. They help you check that your output is as you expected, so you can discover any issues early

---


The usages of these functions are the same as `map()`, except that the output of your function `.f` must be a scalar. The output of `map_***` is guaranteed to be a vector.  

```{r}
map_dbl(x, mean)
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
map_dbl(x, summary)
```

Use `map` if `.f` outputs vectors of different types or with length>1
```{r, error=TRUE}
str(map(x, summary))
```

---
## Combining results

What if the results from calling `.f` are vectors of the same length, and I want to combine the results?

- `do.call(rbind, res)` combines the results by row

```{r}
res <- map(x, summary)
names(res) <- c("first", "second")
do.call(rbind, res)
```

- `do.call(cbind, res)` combines the results by column

- `do.call(f, aList)` is the same as calling `f` using the entries of `aList` as arguments

- So `do.call(cbind, list(a=1, b=2))` is the same as `cbind(a=1, b=2)`

---

## Calling special functions

- Most of the times, functions are in the *prefix form* like `f(x)`

- You have used some operators that are written down a bit specially. E.g., `x + y` and `z[["field"]]`

- These operators are actually all functions
  - `+` is an *infix function*. The equivalent prefix form is 
      ```
      `+`(x, y)
      ```
  - `[[` is an *extraction function*. The prefix form is
      ```
      `[[`(x, name)
      ```
  - Remember to use backtick to quote these functions when calling them and searching the documentations for them
  
- Other infix operators `*, /, %in%` and extractors `[` etc are similar

---

- `purrr` functions can be used to call these special functions

```{r, eval=TRUE}
map(x, `+`, 1)
map(x, `[`, 2)
map(x, 2) # shorthand for extracting the 2nd entry
```

---

## Other variants of `map`

- `walk(.x, .f)` calls `.f` for its side-effect but not for returning new results

- `imap(.x, .f)` iterates over `.x` with an index (either an integer position or a name, depending on whether `.x` is named). E.g.,

    ```{r}
    imap(x, function(x, i) stringr::str_c("Field ", i, " has mean ", mean(x)))
    ```
---

## Other variants of `map`: Varying 2 inputs


`map2(.x, .y, .f)` applies the function `.f` to each parallel pair of entries in `.x` and `.y`

]

```{r}
map2(x, 
     c(0.3, 0), 
     function(v, trim) mean(v, trim=trim))
```

---

## Other variants of `map`: Varying $p$ inputs


`map2(.l, .f)` applies `.f` to each parallel collection of entries in `.l`


.center[

]

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
record <- data.frame(
  student = c("Mary", "John", "Jenny"), 
  id = c(312, 983, 291),
  score = c(92, 69, 87)
)
pmap(record, 
     function(student, id, score) stringr::str_c(student, id, ": ", score, sep=" "))
```

## Calling a function by group

---
## Calling a function by group

- `split(x, f)` separates a vector/data frame `x` according to a factor `f` and returns a list of data frames, each corresponding to one group

```{r}
sLenBySpecies <- split(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species)
summary(sLenBySpecies)
```

- We can then apply the `map` function and friends to the grouped data
```{r}
map(sLenBySpecies, summary)
```

## Reduce and accumulate

---

## Reduce

- Heard about the map-reduce framework for big data?

- Here, "map" means the same as the `map` function, applying the same operation to many inputs, generating multiple intermediate results. E.g., calculate the total sales *in each state*

- "Reduce" means combine the intermediate results to have a final, aggregated result. E.g., *combine* the per state sales to have a total sales

- This is done by combining the first two results, and then that with the third, and so on


---
The `reduce` function in `purrr` performs the reduce operation

.center[
![:scale 40%](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9c239e1227c69b7a2c9c2df234c21f3e1c74dd57/eec0e/diagrams/functionals/reduce.png)
]

- E.g, sum up (revenue, profit)
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
l <- list(IA = c(2, 1), NE = c(1.5, 1), IL=c(5, 2))
reduce(l, `+`)
```

- `.init` specifies the initial value before any combination. The first item will be combined with the initial value

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
reduce(l, `+`, .init=c(0, -1))
```

---

## Accumulate

`accumulate` works like `reduce`, except that `accumulate` keeps all intermediate combined results

```{r}
accumulate(l, `+`)
```

## Your turn (TODO)

<img src="images/blue.png" width=20> Implement a function `mymean` with a single vector input `x` that outputs the mean of `x`, without using the `mean` function

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Call your function on `c(1, 3, 4)` and `c(1, 3, 4, 5)`. Make sure your function has the same output as `mean()`

<img src="images/blue.png" width=20> Now, add a second optional argument to `mymean`, which is a flag `na.rm` that defaults to `FALSE` to indicate whether to remove missing values before the mean calculation. You may use `is.na()`. Again, compare the results from your function and `mean()` to make sure your implementation is correct

---

## Base R apply functions

- `apply`: map functions over margins of a matrix or array

- `lapply`, `sapply`, `vapply`: map functions over a vector or a list; the manners of the return differs

- `tapply`, `by`, `aggregate`: map functions for each group

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(microbenchmark)
set.seed(1)
n <- 1e3
X <- matrix(rnorm(n^2), n, n)
microbenchmark(
  rowMeans(X),
  colMeans(X),
  apply(X, 1, mean),
  apply(X, 2, mean),
  map_dbl(seq_len(n), function(i) mean(X[i, ])),
  map_dbl(seq_len(n), function(i) mean(X[, i]))
