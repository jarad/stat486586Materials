## Reproducible Analysis

---

## R file

- R codes are usually written in R files with extension `.R`

- This is the quickest way to write reproducible codes

- Code in an R file can be run line by line, or with the entire file "sourced", so that all results are reproduced

---

## Markdown

- `Markdown` is a particular type of **markup** language.

- Markup languages are designed to **produce documents from plain text**.

- **Markdown** is becoming a **standard** on the web. Many websites will generate HTML from Markdown (e.g. Piazza, GitHub, Stack Overflow, reddit, ...).

---

## Markdown is easy

```
*italic*
**bold**

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- List item 1
- List item 2
    - item 2a
    - item 2b

1. Numbered list item 1
1. Numbered list item 2
    - item 2a
    - item 2b
```

## Writing math in Markdown

- You can type an equation inline. E.g., `$y = \beta_1 x^2$` is rendered as $y = \beta_1 x^2$

- You can type a displayed equation. E.g., 
```
$$y = \beta_1 x^2$$
``` 
is rendered as 
$$y = \beta_1 x^2$$

- A quick tutorial and cheatsheet is found in this [quick guide](https://rpruim.github.io/s341/S19/from-class/MathinRmd.html)

- Learn it once, use it in many places: E.g., Piazza, LaTeX, GitHub

## Built upon Markdown: RMarkdown

- RMarkdown is an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R 

- It combines the core syntax of markdown with embedded R code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document.

- R Markdown documents are reproducible. They are generated as if you just start up R.

## Why R Markdown?

- **It's simple.** Focus on writing
<!-- , rather than debugging silly errors. -->

- **It's flexible.** 

     - Markdown was created to simplify HTML writing, but thanks to pandoc, Markdown converts to many different formats such as pdf and Word!

    - You can fine tune the [code chunks options](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/)
    
- **It's dynamic.** Get a new dataset? Regenerate your report without copy/paste hell!

- **Encourages transparency.** Collaborators (including your future self) will thank you for integrating your analysis & report.

- **Enables interactivity/reactivity.** Allow your audience to explore the analysis (rather than passively reading it).

## Your Turn


2. <img src="images/green.png" width=20> Open RStudio, create a new RMarkdown file, and knit it.
<!-- 3. <img src="images/green.png" width=20> Navigate to the RMarkdown cheat sheet and download a copy  -->

3. <img src="images/green.png" width=20> Make changes to the markdown formatting (try several) and knit again.

4. <img src="images/green.png" width=20> Export output to different files.

5. <img src="images/blue.png" width=20> If you feel adventurous, change some of the R code and knit again.

6. <img src="images/blue.png" width=20> If you are all done, you can follow the guideline of [HW1](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/88184/assignments/1654121?module_item_id=4391334) and finish the first few questions.
