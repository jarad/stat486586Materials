## Welcome to R

---

## Outline

- R language

- Data types

- Inspecting data

- Making vectors

- Assignment

- Workspace and reproducibility

- Numerical and logical operations

- Indexing

---

## The R language

For someone who had previous programming experience: 

- R is an intuitive high-level programming language

- R has an excellent handling of data, analysis, and graphics.

- You will use R interactively

---

## Some Specifics

- R functions are like mathmatical functions. So `cos(x)` means "return me the cosine of the value of the variable `x`". Not going to modify `x` (calling by value but almost never by reference)

- So R is great for functional programming

- R is case-sensitive, so `function` and `Function` are very different

- R counts from 1 (unlike Python & C++ which counts from 0)

- Easy to access to documentation: E.g., type `?cos` in the R console

---

## R Syntax Examples 

|**Math** | **Code**|
|:-------:|:-------:|
|Assignments $x = \frac{2}{3}$ | `x <- 2/3` |
|Vectors $y = \left( 1, 2, 3, 5\right)$ | `y <- c(1, 2, 3, 5)`|
| Indices $y_1$ | `y[1]` | 
| $2y$ | `2 * y` |
|Functions $\sqrt{x}$ | `sqrt(x)` |
|Mathematical Operators $\sum_{i=1}^{4} y$ | `sum(y)` |


---

## R Data Types

R has different data types:

- Numeric variables, e.g. `3`, `1:20`, `pi`

- Character variables, e.g. `"hello world"`, `c("cat", "dog")`

- Logical variables, e.g. `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `c(FALSE, TRUE)`

- Missing values `NA` (more next time)

- Data frame. Use `$` to extract a column. E.g., `df$column` 

- Matrix (more soon)

- List (more soon)

Here, `c()` is the function for creating a vector (combine/concatenate)

---

## Inspecting objects

for an object `x`, we can try out the following commands:

- `x` 
- `print(x)`
- `str(x)`
- `class(x)`
- `length(x)`
- `head(x)`
- `tail(x)`
- `summary(x)`
- `dim(x)`
- `View(x)` (offered by RStudio, remove from Rmd before knitting)

---

## Loading class data

- Some R packages have built-in datasets

- I made an R package for this class available on github containing datasets

- Installing `classdata` package:

```{r, message=FALSE, results='hide', eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("xdaiISU/classdata")
```

- Make the data available when needed (once after you start R):
```{r}
library(classdata)
```

- In general, `library(pkgname)` loads the package `pkgname` into R

---

## The `cities` data

- `cities` is a data frame with columns (variables) and rows (records)

```{r}
str(cities)
```

---

## Exploring data

We will play with the crime data `cities`. 

- To show what columns are available, use `names(df)`
```{r}
library(classdata) # load the dataset
names(cities)
```

- To extract a column, use `df$column`:
```{r}
cities$City
```

## Your Turn

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Install the package `classdata` on your machine <br>

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Make the package active in your current R session:
```
library(classdata)
```

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Check the R help on the dataset `cities`<br>

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Use the object browser to view the data frame by issuing `View(cities)`.<br>

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Use different R commands to inspect the dataset `cities`.

## Functions for Building a Vector

- `c()`, for combining elements and vectors

- `:`, for creating a simple sequence of numbers. E.g., `1:10`

- `seq()`, for creating a sequence of numbers

- `rep()`, for repeating a vector

- `ifelse()`, for creating a vector where the value of each entry depends on a logical vector

- `vector(mode = "numeric", length=10)`, for initializing a numeric vector of length 10. .style[We will need it sometimes, but initialization can most of the time be avoided in R]

More details in the demo

---

## Assignment

- `<-` is the assignment operator. `=` can also be used as an assignment operator, .style[but avoid it as a matter of style.] E.g., 
  ```{r}
  x <- c(2, 5)
  ```
- You can assign names and other attributes
  ```{r}
  names(x) <- c("male", "female")
  x
  ```
  ```{r}
  class(x) <- "tally"
  x
  ```


---

## R workspace

- Your current R environment is called the *workspace*. It contains all variables you defined.

- Your workspace lives in your computer memory and will be cleared once you exit R

- To see what variables are in the workspace, use 

```{r}
ls()
```

- Use `rm()` to remove one or more variables

```{r}
rm(x)
ls()
``` 

---

## Reproducibility

- For reproducibility, you want any meaningful work to be reproducible. Namely, the .danger[results should be reproduced by running the **code** you saved, but not by saving the results directly]

- Thus, saving R variables onto your hard disk is not a great idea

- Instead, a great idea is to always write code in a `.R` or `.Rmd` file

- When exiting R, you will be prompted to save the workspace image. **Always select Don't Save** for reproduciblity

## R demo

class: inverse

## Your Turn

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Introduce vector $x$ defined as $x = (4, 1, 3, 9)$ and $y$ defined as $y = (1, 2, 3, 4)$

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Create character vector $z$ containing `c`, `b`, and `a` in its three entries

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Save your code in either a `.R` or a `.Rmd` file

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Restart RStudio *without* saving workspace image. Then reproduce vectors `x`, `y`, and `z` by rerunning the code you saved


---

## Numerical Opertions

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, Add, substract, multiple, and divide

- `x ^ a`, x raised to the power of a

- `x %/% y`, x integer divided by y (fractional part is discarded)

- `x %% y`, take the remainder of x integer divided by y (also called modulo or mod)

- Note the operator precedence, namely, which operation is calculated before which. See `?Syntax`

---

## Comparison Operations

- `a == b`, test whether two variables equal elementwise. To test equality for objects as a whole, use `identical(a, b)`

- `a != b`, test whether two variables are different elementwise

- `a > b`, `a < b`, `a >= b`, `a <= b`, comparisons

- `a %in% b`, whether each element of `a` is a member of `b`

---

## Vectorized Operations

- Most of the R opeartions and functions are vectorized. Namely, they apply to vectors and not just to scalars

- The calculation will be performed for each element in the vector. E.g., 

  ```{r}
  1:4 + 4:1
  1:4 + 2
  ```
  
- The *recycling rule*: Basic R operations follow a recycling rule: If the two vectors have different length, the shorter one will be repeated so match the length of the longer one. .style[Write code in an intuitive way]

  ```{r}
  rep(30, 6) + c(1, 0) # Add one day to odd months
  ```

---
class: inverse

## Your Turn

Continue the last Your turn.

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Play with the arithmatic and comparison operators on `x` and `y`

<img src="images/blue.png" width=20> Evaluate `rep(0, 9) + 1:3`. Reason about the result with the recycling rule


---

## Indexing with Integers

- Use square brackets `[]` to extract index or modify indexed entries
- Note that R counts from 1
- Indexing with integers: 
```{r}
x <- month.abb
x[1]
x[c(6, 6, 7, 8)]
x[c(6, 7, 8)] <- "break!"
x
x[-1] # What does negative index mean?
```


---

## Indexing with Names

- Indexing with names: The index vector can be a character vector

```{r}
pets <- c(cat = 10, dog = 15, lizard = 2)
pets
pets[c("cat", "dog")]
```

---

## Indexing with Logicals

- Indexing with logicals: E.g., `x[logiVec]`. You can use a logical vector with the same length as `x` to index

```{r}
x <- 1:3
x[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

- Oftentimes the logical index vector is created by comparison

```{r}
x[x > 2]
```

---

## Which

- `which(logiVec)` returns the integer positions where the entry of `logiVec` is `TRUE`

```{r}
logi <- month.abb == "Jun"
logi
which(logi)
month.abb[which(logi) + 2]
```

---

## Indexing Data Frames

For a data frame `x`, we can extract parts in the following manner:

```
x$variable
x[, "variable"]
x$variable[rows]

x[rows, columns]
x[1:5, 2:3]
x[c(1,5,6), c("State", "Year")]
```

- `rows` and `columns` each can be a vector of integer position indices or a logical vector 

- `columns` can also be a character vector specifying the names. .style[This is the preferred way of specifying the columns]

- `x[, "variable"]` will give a vector (not a data frame any more).</br>
`x[, "variable", drop=TRUE]` will give a data frame with a single column
