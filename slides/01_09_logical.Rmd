## Logical vectors and operations

- Vectors consisting of values `TRUE` and `FALSE`

- `&` and `|` are the logical *and* and *or*

- `!` is the logical negation

- `<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=` are comparison operators that returns a logical vector

- use parentheses `()` when linking expressions to avoid mis-interpretation

- `x %in% c(1, 3, 5)` tells whether each element of `x` is one of `c(1, 3, 5)`

- `ifelse` assigns values in a vector according to a logical variable

---

## Subsetting Data Frames
```{r}
library(classdata)
dat2009 <- cities[cities$City %in% c("Ames", "Ankeny") & 
                     cities$Year == 2009, ]
str(dat2009)
```

<!-- Other useful functions for subsetting data frames are `subset` and `dplyr::filter` (later) -->

## Your turn


Define a vector: `a <- c(1, 15, 3, 20, 5, 8, 9, 10, 1, 3)`

Create logical vectors to indicate which entries in  `a` are:

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> less than 20<br/>

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> squared value is either at least 100 or less than 10<br/>

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> equals 1 or 3 or 5<br/>


Work on the `cities` dataset in the `classdata` library

<img src="images/green.png" width=20> Get a subset of all data from 2009 to 2012.

<img src="images/blue.png" width=20> Get a subset of all crimes in 2009 in Ames and 2 of its neighboring cities (say, Ankeny and Huxley).

## Missing values

---

## Missing values in R

- `NA` is the special code for "not available"
- R consistently handles mising values. Eg. we get 
```{r}
NA + 1
```

```{r}
NA | TRUE
```
- Caution: Direct testing for missing values with `==` will result in an `NA`:
```{r}
x <- c(1, NA)
x == NA
```
<!-- - `NaN` is the code for "not a number", e.g. in 0/0 -->

---

## Essential functions 

- Use function `is.na` for testing `NA`s
```{r}
x <- c(1, NA)
is.na(x)
```

- `complete.cases(data)` test the existence of `NA`s in the rows of data frames
<!-- - `drop_na(data, col1, ...)` drops the rows if `NA`s exist in `col1` or additional columns -->

```{r}
x[complete.cases(x)]
```

---

## Handling missing values

There are a few principles for handing missing values. 

- Errors in the dataset should be removed and investigated
    - E.g., IDs

- If uncertain whether missing values are due to errors, perform analysis with as little distortion to the data as possible
    - E.g., use all available information in each column to calculate the column means, instead of removing all rows containing missing values

- Performing a sensitivity analysis is a good idea: One version with missing values, and the other without. Compare the results.
